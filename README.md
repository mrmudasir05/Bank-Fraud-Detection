# Bank App
## Banking app using python, pyQt5 and SQLite for database


# INTRODUCTIONS

This is a simulation of a simple banking Desktop Application using Python for the core coding, This software can be used for day to day operations of Most banks with little or no need for adjustment

# Overview
-Fraud Detection in Banking Transactions is a project focused on developing a system that can detect fraudulent activities within banking transactions. The system utilizes machine learning techniques to analyze transaction data, PyQt5 for a user-friendly graphical interface, and SQLite for efficient data storage and retrieval.

# Technologies used
-Python
-Machine Learning (Scikit-Learn, PandasNumpy, matplotlib, pickle, and Random Forest )
-PyQt5
-SQLite
#  FEATURES
